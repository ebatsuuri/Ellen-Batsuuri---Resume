        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/International RelationsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Ever since my freshman year, I have been involved in my schoolâ€™s leadership class and student government. Through my time in the class, I have learned how to plan and throw successful events for the student body. Additionally my work as Associated Student Body Secretary and President we worked with over 60 clubs and over 250 club officers in throwing Club Fairs which was hosted once at the beginning of each semester to showcase all of our amazing clubs on campus to the entire student body. At Aragon one of our most beloved parts of our campus is how diverse and inclusive we are and being apart of the leadership program we always want to ensure that our culture and environment at school is always one of a diverse and loving nature, so the club fair is one of our best ways to truly honor this wonderful and truly special aspect of our school!. Aside from ASB at Aragon, I also had the honor to serve as the San Mateo Union High School District Board Representative. My responsibilities included speaking to the Board twice a month every month and one of the projects that I had worked on with several other students was revamping our dress code. I helped collect testimonies from our different schools in the district in how dress code has affected our day to day lives especially for young females. The language of our dress code had suggested that this was the femaleâ€™s fault and had seemed as if it was targeting us with its sexist and demeaning language. We worked hard all year and went through multiple drafts of the dress code and meetings with the board, and finally for the following school year we were able to change specific sections as well as adding in a section about training and enforcement so when students do break the dress code our staffulty will be able to take them aside and be able to inform them they are breaking the dress code without embarrassing them in front of their peers and disrupting them from the learning environment.<br><br>

        Additionally, I have had extensive leadership opportunities throughout my time in Key Club. I have served as secretary, president, social media coordinator, and member recognition chair. With the variety of positions I have held has been essential to me becoming very well rounded and versatile in any position I might obtain in my future work. Due to these positions, Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to have worked with a wide range of people, stemming from other school officials, students, and club officers both within my own school and outside my district, as well as professionals, adults, and etc. <br><br>

        Finally, within my first year of college I was graciously given a great opportunity to serve as an orientation leader this upcoming summer for incoming first years and transfer students! This is very exciting because I remember how warm and friendly my orientation leader was when I was a very scared first year not knowing what to expect, so I hope to be this resource for many other first years similar to how my own orientation leader was. Additionally, I now serve as the Vice President of Service for Circle K. With this position, Iâ€™ll have the opportunity to create and manage service events, which is a core tenet of our club. I hope through this position Iâ€™ll be better equipped to serve the greater Riverside community while also enriching the experiences of many memes and instill the love of giving back.
